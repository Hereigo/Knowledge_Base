            The New Way : Using Intersection Observer API The Intersection Observer API makes it possible to know when an element enters or exits the browser viewport. There is no need to attach any event handlers. Furthermore, this API is asynchronous — monitoring
            element for visibility is not done on the main thread. This is a major performance boost. The Intersection Observer API can calculate intersection between a target element and the browser viewport. In simple terms it can tell whether the target
            element and the screen overlap (through isIntersecting property), and by how much percentage they overlap (through a intersectionRatio property). You can create a new IntersectionObserver object, and set a threshold. threshold is a number
            between 0 and 1, that represents the viewable area of the target element in the screen. For example, 0 represents no area of element is visible. A value of 0.10 represents about 10% area is viewable in screen. Value of 1 means element is fully
            viewable in screen. You can even specify multiple thresholds. Intersection Observer will fire a callback function, once the threshold is passed in either direction. For example if you have set threshold to 0.10, callback function will be invoked
            everytime when viewable area becomes greater than 10% or becomes less than 10%. In the current case where we just want to know when element becomes viewable in screen, the Javascript code will be : var observer = new IntersectionObserver(function(entries)
            { // isIntersecting is true when element and viewport are overlapping // isIntersecting is false when element and viewport don't overlap if(entries[0].isIntersecting === true) console.log('Element has just become visible in screen'); }, {
            threshold: [0] }); observer.observe(document.querySelector("#main-container")); If we want to know when element becomes fully visible in screen : var observer = new IntersectionObserver(function(entries) { if(entries[0].isIntersecting ===
            true) console.log('Element is fully visible in screen'); }, { threshold: [1] }); observer.observe(document.querySelector("#main-container")); The Intersection Observer API has more features, but further details are not discussed here. You
            can checkout Intersection Observer API Tutorial for more.
